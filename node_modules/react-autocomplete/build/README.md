React Autocomplete
==================

Accessible, extensible, Autocomplete for React.js.

[![Travis build status](http://img.shields.io/travis/reactjs/react-autocomplete.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/react-autocomplete/)

Docs coming soon, for now just look at the `propTypes` and [examples](https://reactjs.github.io/react-autocomplete/) :)

Trying to settle on the right API, and then focus hard on accessibility,
there are a few missing bits right now.

Stuff we need help with:

- mobile support verification generally
- default mobile styles/positioniong (you'll notice the styles are
  pretty lean, on purpose, apps should style this however they'd like)
- tests (eventually)

# Tests!

Run them:
`npm test`

Write them:
`lib/__tests__/Autocomplete-test.js`

Check your work:
`npm run coverage`
