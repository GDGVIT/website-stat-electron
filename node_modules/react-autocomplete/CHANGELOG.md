# CHANGELOG
We try to follow [http://keepachangelog.com/](http://keepachangelog.com/) recommendations for easier to update & more readable change logs.

## [Unreleased]
_(add items here for easier creation of next log entry)_

## [1.3.1] - 2016-08-01
### Changed
- Re-publish without `node_modules` and `coverage` included in tarball

## [1.3.0] - 2016-08-01
### Added
- `props.open` to manually control when the menu is open/closed (#163)
- `props.onMenuVisibilityChange` callback that is invoked every time the menu is opened/closed by `Autocomplete`'s internal logic. Pairs well with `props.open` for granulated control over the menu's visibility (#163)

### Removed
- `bower.json` has been removed from the repo

## [1.2.1] - 2016-08-09
### Fixed
- `build/package.json` incorrectly stated `1.1.0` for the version, a quick rebuild and
patch version publish got these back in sync.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-08-09
### Added
- `props.autoHighlight` to toggle automatic highlighting of top match (see #146 & #159)

### Fixed
- Bug which prevented menu from closing properly in IE (see #153)
- .babelrc presets were causing 1 user(s) to not be able to run tests locally with Jest

## [1.1.0] - 2016-08-02
### Added
- Ability to return custom components from renderMenu/renderItem (see #127)
- Added missing `propTypes`
- Jest for testing (replaces mocha/isparta)
- eslint consuming the rackt config

### Fixed
- Custom Menu Example (#81)
- Bug causing menu to close immediately when clicking into input (#84)
- Bug referencing `this.state.value` (has since been moved to props)
- Reset `highlightedIndex` when it's outside `items.length` (#139)
- Removed typeahead behavior for improved mobile functionality (#40, #111, #152)

### Updated
- rackt-cli (#131, #51, #107)
- repo urls (#114)
- Jest ignore rules & configurations


## [1.0.1] - 2016-06-26

--------------------------------------

- Updated propTypes for several props being used but not included here
- Several issues and fixes from #68, #84, #92, #93, #103, #104, #106
- Actually built the build/dist files and included them in the publish

v1.0.0-rc5 - 5 June 2016
--------------------------------------

- Demoted React to peerDependency


v1.0.0-rc3 - 25 May 2016

--------------------------------------

- Updated this component to no longer use internal state
for retaining value, this is prop driven now.
- The version number `1.0.0-rc1` is an unforunate coincidence,
We're only bumping this as it introduces breaking changes.

have tests of course)
